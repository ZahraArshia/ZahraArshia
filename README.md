# Hi there 👋

### About me 🖥️
🆘 I'm a hardware engineer stucking in software world by mistake! (Help Me!)

🔎 I know how to deal with microcontrollers, microprocessors, wires and transistor, but I don't know how to design a webpage so I'm trying to learn software development!

🎓 I have a master's degree in AI 🧠 with the focus on NLP (I don't like it, though! I prefer DIP)

🛠 and I love repairing electronic devices! (it makes me feel like i'm doing something smart like Tony Stark! 🤖)
